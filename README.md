## 4.Usage
+ Design the 3D Robot based on the image
+ Design the Tiva C Controller to control the robot
+ Build the binary file from the source code (Code Compiler Studio software is recommended for this compile)
+ Embed the built binary to the Tiva-C micro controller
+ Experiment and observe the result
